# Resource Scoping

## cgroup v2 Resource Scoping Mechanism

Sinex runs under systemd, which uses Linux cgroup v2 (unified hierarchy) for
resource control. The current NixOS deployment folds source contracts and automata
into `sinexd.service`; per-source generated service emission is disabled. The
resource profile still lives in the NixOS module and is applied through the
service configuration helpers in `nixos/modules/sources.nix`.

### Per-Service Resource Limits

The long-running `sinexd` service inherits the configured resource profile,
which can apply:

- `MemoryHigh` — soft memory pressure threshold
- `MemoryMax` — hard memory cap; the OOM killer fires when exceeded
- `CPUWeight` / `IOWeight` — relative CPU and I/O priority
- `CPUQuota` — optional CPU bandwidth limit as a percentage value (e.g. `200%` = 2 cores)
- `TimeoutStopSec` — graceful shutdown window before SIGKILL
- `LimitNOFILE` — file descriptor cap (set when the resource profile requests it)

These are configured through the NixOS module options at
`services.sinex.runtime.defaults.resources` (global defaults) and per-runtime-module
`services.sinex.runtime.<name>.resources` overrides.

### Runtime Resource Profiles

Resource profiles are defined in the NixOS module as:

```
services.sinex.runtime.defaults.resources = {
  memoryMax = "512M";
  cpuQuota = "200%";
  shutdownTimeoutSec = 30;
  openFilesLimit = 16384;
};
```

### Checking Resource Limits at Runtime

- `systemctl show <service> -p MemoryCurrent,MemoryMax,CPUUsageNSec` — live usage
- `systemd-cgtop` — interactive cgroup resource monitor
- `/sys/fs/cgroup/system.slice/<service>.service/` — raw cgroup v2 stats
- `xtask status` — workspace-level health summary (does not check cgroup limits)

### xtask devshell Resource Limits

The `xtask` binary itself runs within whatever cgroup the calling shell provides.
For heavy development commands (e.g. `xtask check --full`, `xtask test --heavy`),
the project `direnv` and `nix develop` environments do not currently impose
additional cgroup limits — the development shell inherits the user session cgroup.

When running heavy operations, use the `sinnix-scope` wrapper (available on
`sinnix-prime`) to route long-running commands into a resource-bounded slice:

```bash
sinnix-scope build -- xtask check --full
sinnix-scope background -- xtask test --heavy
```

These slices are configured in the NixOS system configuration (`sinnix` repo,
not `sinex`), with CPU and memory limits appropriate for background build work.

### cgroup v2 Availability Check

The `xtask doctor --runtime` command currently checks NATS connectivity,
PostgreSQL health, consumer lag, and batch latency, but does **not** verify
cgroup v2 availability or that the running services are actually constrained
by the configured resource limits. This is a known gap — a future `xtask doctor
--runtime` enhancement should:

1. Check that `/sys/fs/cgroup` is mounted as cgroup2
2. Verify each running Sinex service has `MemoryMax` set in its cgroup
3. Warn if any service is near its memory limit

### Pressure Stall Information

Linux PSI metrics (`/proc/pressure/io`, `/proc/pressure/memory`) are exposed
through the inline `sinexd::runtime::PressureMonitor` type. CAS write paths can
check pressure before large I/O operations and apply bounded backoff when the
system is under resource contention. See
`crate/sinexd/src/runtime/pressure.rs`.
